What is the strategic plan for the insurance sector from 2021-2030? ,"The strategic plan for the insurance sector in Cambodia from 2021-2030 aims to foster the development of the sector amidst the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan focuses on key areas such as institutional framework, technical capability, cooperation, and public awareness. It emphasizes the need for financial-sector integration under regional and global frameworks and compliance with the Insurance Core Principles of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.

The plan highlights several key points:

Macro-Economic Policy Framework: Cambodia's economy is expected to recover with a growth rate of 4% in 2021. The industrial sector may experience slow growth, while the service sector is expected to have robust growth. The plan takes into account the slow recovery of construction and garment sub-sectors.

Challenges and Opportunities: The sale of certain insurance products, such as travel insurance and aviation insurance, has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan acknowledges the trend of implementing cross-border insurance within the ASEAN region, which will lead to competition based on the quality of services and capabilities of insurance companies. It also highlights the need for a sufficient quantity and quality of human resources with insurance professionalism.

International Cooperation: The plan emphasizes the importance of participating in regional and global forums related to insurance and private pension sectors. It also mentions the participation and updating of the Insurance Core Principles of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.

Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation Mechanism: The plan outlines the implementation mechanism for the 10-year strategic plan, which has been prepared by the Insurance Regulator of Cambodia (IRC). It acknowledges the challenges faced in formulating the plan due to the lack of a scientific and technical study on the progress of the insurance sector. The plan is based on practical and realistic fundamentals, using data from the Cambodian insurance market and studying experiences from other countries in the region."
